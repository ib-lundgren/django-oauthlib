Django-OAuthLib
===============

Starting as a migration of the django decorator from `OAuthLib`_ this project
will aim to become a full featured, secure, easy to use OAuth provider
extension for Django supplying everything you will need to protect your
precious API with OAuth, both OAuth 1 and OAuth 2 will be supported.

Sounds like something you would like to help out with? Let me know by opening
an issue or getting in touch on `G+`_ or IRC (#oauthlib on Freenode).
